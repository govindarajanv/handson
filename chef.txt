1. Setting up QA environment from scratch

This includes creating a new environment file with required attributes, setting right cookbook versions and dependencies, node jsons, run list and roles associated with the nodes.
All the nodes were bootstrapped with proper roles and runlists.

2. Setting up bamboo plan to seamless upload of cookbooks triggers by git check-ins. This ensures that two chef server will never go out of sync.

3. Enable automation to run curl commands which are shared as part of release setup activities. The problem was addressed by treating curl commands as artificats from engineering team. This ensured that Dev team owned the curl commands. There was also a compliance issue which curl commands were executed separately or as part of chef keeping them as standalone bash scripts. The method we adopted helped us to ensure that we are adhering to the compliance. Intelligence is brought into the cookbook to keep track of successful execution of curl scripts so that idempotence is maintained. This was achieved through data bags. Bamboo plan ensures that it tests those scripts in dev environment and a developer cannot check-in a errorenous script.
